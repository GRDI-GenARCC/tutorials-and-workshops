- This workshop is a result of feedback from AAFC's Bioinformatic Conference 2020

  - This workshop and training material will be **iteratively developed**
    - Starting with something is much better than nothing, and with time, expertise, and user feedback, this workshop will continuously improve
    - User feedback is collected after workshop sessions, but you can contribute ideas by filing an **Issue** in the main repository
