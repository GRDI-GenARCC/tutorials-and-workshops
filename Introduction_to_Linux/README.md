- This repository contains `Introduction to Linux` in 4 parts
- These are designed to be completed in 1 hour workshop sessions
  - There are also optional materials for practice and enrichment
- They can also be completed outside of workshops at your own pace

<br>

- This workshop is a result of feedback from our Bioinformatic Conference 2020
  - User interest in learning how to use Linux and bioinformatics tools is high, but one session during the conference was too short
  - This workshop and other future workshops will act as longstanding resources to build bioinformatics skills across AAFC
  - This workshop and training material will be **iteratively developed**
    - Starting with something is much better than nothing, and with time, expertise, and user feedback this workshop will continuously improve
    - User feedback is collected after workshop sessions, but you can contribute ideas by filing an **Issue** in the main repository
- Previously the most recent material was included in the "wiki" panel, but now all files will only be in the main repository
  - Improved links and navigation will allow for a "wiki"-style viewing experience, without the duplication and complexity

  <br>

- These materials are intended to support AAFC staff in bioinformatics research at various skill levels
- They are a supplement to other available resources - see [BRSN Resource Overview](https://collab.agr.gc.ca/co/BRS-SRB/SitePages/Resource%20Overview.aspx)
