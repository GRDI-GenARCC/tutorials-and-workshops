# Introduction to Linux

- WIP - File issues with GitLab to highlight potential additions or errors

- This repository contains `Introduction to Linux` in 3 parts
- These are designed to be completed in 1-1.5 hour workshop sessions, with 1 hour of interactive instruction and an optional half an hour of challenge exercises
- They can also be completed outside of workshops at your own pace
- To view the most recent material it is recommended to use the `Wiki` panel on the left of the page
  - The same material will be available here in the repository with the additional option to view past releases via tags

- These materials are intended to support AAFC staff in bioinformatics research at various skill levels
- They are a supplement to other available resources - see [BRSN Resource Overview](https://collab.agr.gc.ca/co/BRS-SRB/SitePages/Resource%20Overview.aspx)
