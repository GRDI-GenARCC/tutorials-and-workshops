# Linux Resources

- Welcome to the Linux Resources repository
  - This repo contains:
    - [Introduction to Linux Workshop](/Introduction_to_Linux/README.md)
      - Links to each session: [Part 1](/Introduction_to_Linux/Intro_Linux_1.md), [Part 2](/Introduction_to_Linux/Intro_Linux_2.md), [Part 3](/Introduction_to_Linux/Intro_Linux_3.md), [Part 4](/Introduction_to_Linux/Intro_Linux_4.md)
    - [WSL Workshop](/WSL_Workshop/README.md)

- Previously some resources were duplicated to the wiki but all files will now be in the main repository only.
  - These files will have improved linking and navigation, providing a wiki-style experience.

- These tutorials are intended to support AAFC staff in bioinformatics research at various skill levels
- They are a supplement to other available resources - see [BRSN Resource Overview](https://collab.agr.gc.ca/co/BRS-SRB/SitePages/Resource%20Overview.aspx)
- New tutorials will be released over time, and existing tutorials updated as necessary
