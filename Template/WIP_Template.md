## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Prerequisite(s)

- Required setup or knowledge needed to participate in the tutorial

1.2 Objectives:
- Goals of the tutorial
- What users can expect to learn

1.4 Questions?


# 2. Introduction

2.1 Context for the tutorial (if necessary)
- Background information to help understanding
- eg. Intro Linux - give brief history to explain why we use CLI

2.2 Questions?


# 3. Instruction
- Start the pattern of instruct, exercise, discussion
- Map out content before writing any of the tutorial to help break it down into subsections
- It can be beneficial to have mini-exercises within a subsection, before building into an exercise at the end of the section

## 3.1 Subsection
- Teach a concept
- Ideally have a mini-exercise about the concept
- When an exercise is not necessary but there are commands I use a code block with a designation to "Try it yourself"
- markdown supports highlighting for most languages, specify after the triple-backtick
```bash
mkdir this_tutorial_is_fun
```

### 3.11 Exercise
- Have it be self-directed, but with help or hints available

## 3.2 Subsection
- More content

### 3.21 Exercise
- Another mini-exercise

## 3.3 Challenge
- This should be self-directed and fairly short
- Include instructions but allow for users to explore themselves if applicable

## 3.4 Discussion


# 4. New Instruction

## 4.1 Subsection

## 4.2 Subsection

## 4.3 Exercise

## 4.4 Discussion
